This is both a great way to learn, and also helps you as a coder to proactively identify instances where ChatGPT has got stuck.\n",

    "\n",
    "To run this Jupyter notebook, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. make sure the `dsa` environment you created in step 2 is activated\n",
    "2. install jupyter into this environment using the `pip install jupyter` command (installing something *into* an environment just means that you need to run the installation command after having activated the environment)\n",
    "3. now move into the directory for the DS&A repository that you cloned in step 3 (called `data_structures_and_algorithms_2025`).\n",
    "4. run `jupyter notebook`; this will start your default browser (or open a new tab) and you should now see a folder structure that includes the Jupyter notebook file `lab1.ipynb`\n",

    "### 5. Set up your IDE\n",
    "- After step 4., you can now write code in Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "- For the type of coding necessary for larger (and collaborative) projects, you'll also need an IDE (integrated development environment). IDEs are easier to use than base Jupyter notebook - as run from the command line above.\n",
    "- This is where you'll write classes, functions, helper functions, tests etc. \n",
    "- I recommend VS Code or PyCharm, because it they have many 'intelligent code' features such as code prediction, readability, error detection, easy refactoring, and because it provides debugging tools.\n",

    "        - select `Open Folder`\n",
    "        - select the `Interpreter` (top right, also the central top bar), choose the Python installation that is within the `dsa` conda environment you created abov\n",
    "    - **For PyCharm**\n",
    "        - on the `New Project` screen, set the `Location` path to the path to the `data_structures_and_algorithms_2025` directory \n",
